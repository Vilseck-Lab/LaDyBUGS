In this repository, we provide scripts for performing ligand perturbations with LaDyBUGS using OpenMM and CHARMM force fields. Setup scripts are presented in `1.gen_charmm_psf` and `2.gen_omm_system`. Production scripts can be found in `3.ladybugs`. In `example` directories, we provide example files for performing a LaDyBUGS calculation on a series of ligands bound to MUP1.
